ImplementAI is hosted by McGill Artificial Intelligence Society, which is a 24-hour hackathon to learn how AI can be used to overcome societal problems and boost competitiveness. There are five sponsor challenges and we chose the challenge from CAE. 
CAE is a company which provides flight simulators as well as training solution for the airline companies (https://www.cae.com/).

# CAE Project
In order to help CAE to improve their way to train pilots and make flight safer, we developed a model to return if the competency has to be flagged according to the features of the  simulation. 
There are five challenges for this project: time series analysis, under 500 samples, risk of mislabel data, unbalanced data and difference data size. We came up with ideas to solve these five challenges
